Notebook filament_extraction_from_mock_data.nb contains the step-by-step procedure for extracting the filament network from data in the file mock_data.txt. It was tested in Wolfram Mathematica versions 10.4 and 11.1.

 - The file catalog_of_filaments.txt contains the resulting filament network extracted from the HyperLeda data, in 16 consecutive equisized redshift bins from z=0.02 to z=0.1.
 - The file catalog_of_intersections.txt contains the locations of filaments' intersections in each redshift bin.
 - The file catalog_of_voids.txt contains the locations of voids' centroids in each redshift bin.
